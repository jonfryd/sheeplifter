## Overview ##

This is the weird, fun and addictive 3D game, which we have dubbed Sheeplifter, loosely based on Br√∏derbund's 80es classic [Choplifter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choplifter). To play the game successfully the player must possess a combination of navigation skills and planning ability.

As a space wolf from outer space you must abduct all sheep on the volcanic island. By using your abductor beam you can lift sheep from the ground (or water) onto your ship. To complete the abduction, return the sheep to the vortex centrifuge.

The game is driven by [Java Monkey Engine](http://www.jmonkeyengine.com/) and features a good deal of procedurally generated content (such as the randomly terraformed terrain). You will never play the same game twice!

The original version of the game was made for the Bring From Home track at [Nordic Game Jam 2009](http://www.nordicgamejam.org/).

_Update June 19, 2010: Release 2 is ready for download featuring slightly improved controls and [OpenAL Soft](http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html) sound rendering for Mac (fixes 3D audio issues). Also, the entire source code is now available via SVN._
