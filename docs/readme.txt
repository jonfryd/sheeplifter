Nordic Game Jam 2009 Release (SVN rev. 584)
===========================================

==========
Background
==========

We took the mad scientist approach and created a weird 3D game loosely 
based on Broderbund's 80es classic Choplifter. To play the game 
successfully the player must possess a combination of good navigation 
skills and planning ability.

The game is driven by Java Monkey Engine and features a good deal of 
procedurally generated content (such as the randomly terraformed 
terrain). You will never play the same game twice. ;-)

How to play
===========

As a space wolf from outer space you must abduct all sheep on the 
volcanic island. By using your abductor beam you can lift sheep from
the ground (or water) onto your ship. To complete the abduction, return
the sheep to the vortex centrifuge. 

Rules: 
- You have 3 minutes and 20 seconds until the island is completely 
flooded. 
- A sheep can survive no longer than 30 seconds in the hot water. 
- Your ship can carry no more than 5 sheep at a time.

A word of advice: carefully plan the order you abduct your victims. 

Good luck, captain!
